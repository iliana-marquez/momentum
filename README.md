Momentum is a life-tracking web app that helps you stay present while building your future. It prevents overwhelm by syncing your life areas into one clear dashboard, where task management, progress bars, and the Life Sync Chart make balance visual and intuitive — guiding steady, meaningful progress toward your full potential.

## User Experience (UX)

### Current User Story Goals#

As User, I want:
- To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn how it can help me balance different areas of my life.
- To quickly log in and see my current progress across all life areas through the dashboard's Life Sync pie chart and progress bars.
- To add, edit, complete or delete tasks efficiently while seeing immediate visual feedback through dynamic modals.
- To add, edit, complete or delete milestones efficiently while seeing immediate visual feedback.
- To see my tasks automatically categorized (Today, This Week, Overdue, Done, Expired) and my milestones organized by life goal categories.
- To see real-time updates to the Life Sync chart and progress percentages as I complete tasks.
- To visualize my next due milestones prominently on the dashboard so I stay focused on important deadlines and prevent "out of sight, out of mind" forgetting.
- My data to persist during my browser session so I don't lose updates while navigating between pages.
