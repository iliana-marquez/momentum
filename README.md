## User Experience (UX)

### Current User Story Goals

As User, I want:
- To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn how it can help me balance different areas of my life.
- To quickly log in and see my current progress across all life areas through the dashboard's Life Sync pie chart and progress bars.
- To add, edit, complete or delete tasks efficiently while seeing immediate visual feedback through dynamic modals.
- To add, edit, complete or delete milestones efficiently while seeing immediate visual feedback.
- To see my tasks automatically categorized (Today, This Week, Overdue, Done, Expired) and my milestones organized by life goal categories.
- To see real-time updates to the Life Sync chart and progress percentages as I complete tasks.
- To visualize my next due milestones prominently on the dashboard so I stay focused on important deadlines and prevent "out of sight, out of mind" forgetting.
- My data to persist during my browser session so I don't lose updates while navigating between pages.

### Design

- **Result**: Application remains responsive under heavy task creation

#### Task Categorization Gap (Data Integrity Fix)
