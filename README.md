# Momentum 

Momentum is a life-tracking web app that helps you stay present while building your future. It prevents overwhelm by syncing your life areas into one clear dashboard, where task management, progress bars, and the Life Sync Chart make balance visual and intuitive — guiding steady, meaningful progress toward your full potential.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories
- **As a user,** I want to add tasks easily, so I can track my goals without hassle.
- **As a user,** I want a chart to see how my life balances, so I can adjust my focus.
- **As a user,** I want progress bars for today and the week, so I feel present and motivated.
- **As a user,** I want a simple login, so I can jump into my day fast.
- **As a user,** I want tasks sorted by Today, Week, After, Done, Expired, so I stay organized.

#### Original Ideas (Time Ran Out)
- Daily checkup—intuitive questions to reflect on life goals.
- Edit/delete tasks—full CRUD control.
- Dynamic register—new users join.
- Milestones/profile—track big wins, personalize.
